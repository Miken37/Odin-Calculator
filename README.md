Two known bugs that I may fix...
1) My decimal point check is flawed, if you input: 50. it checks that its a whole number and allows a second decimal (50..). Likewise if you type in 50.0 -
  it lets you put in 50.0.
2) Back button is broken. It works when back spacing then pressing equals or an operation, but if you press a number it adds number onto previous number before
  it removed last number.
